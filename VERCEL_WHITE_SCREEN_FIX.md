# Vercel White Screen Fix

## Current Issue
Your app is deploying successfully but showing a white screen. This is a common issue with React/Vite apps on Vercel.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Updated vercel.json Configuration
I've updated your `vercel.json` to properly handle static assets:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
When you visit your deployed site:
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any error messages in red

### 3. Common Solutions

**A. Asset Path Issues**
If you see 404 errors for assets, try this alternative vercel.json:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**B. Environment Variables**
Make sure you have these set in Vercel:
- `CI` = `false`
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`

**C. Remove Homepage Property**
If you have a `homepage` property in package.json from previous deployments, it might be causing issues. Since you can't edit package.json in Replit, this shouldn't be the issue.

### 4. Test Locally
To test if the build works locally:
1. Run `npx vite build` in your project
2. Run `npx vite preview` to serve the built files
3. Visit the preview URL to see if it works

### 5. Alternative: Use Netlify
If Vercel continues to have issues, try Netlify:
1. Rename `vercel.json` to `vercel-backup.json`
2. Use the `netlify.toml` I created earlier
3. Deploy to Netlify instead

### 6. Debug Information
Your build is working correctly:
- ✅ index.html is generated
- ✅ CSS and JS assets are built
- ✅ Files are in the correct location

The issue is likely with asset serving or routing on Vercel.

### 7. Quick Fix to Try
Replace your current `vercel.json` with this minimal version:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

Then redeploy and see if it works.

### 8. What to Check Next
1. Are there any JavaScript errors in the browser console?
2. Are the CSS and JS files loading (check Network tab in dev tools)?
3. Is the root element `<div id="root"></div>` being found?

Let me know what you see in the browser console and I can provide more specific fixes!
